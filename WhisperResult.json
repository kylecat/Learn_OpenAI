{"text": " The vertical farming offers new opportunities for meeting future food demands. The closed environment allows climate resilience year-round cultivation of crops. Water consumption is minimal. Plants are less exposed to chemical and disease. Does it work? Isn't the energy used a drawback? Is it sustainable? Experts are here to clear your fears. Welcome to the ISHS Talks on Vertical Farming. As a yet professor at North Carolina State University, research and education in controlled environmental culture, awarded early career innovator and co-founder of start-back companies on plant propagation and vertical farm technology. It is my pleasure to introduce Ricardo Evanes. Thank you very much for the introduction. Again, my name is Ricardo Hernandez and I am an associate professor at North Carolina State University. Today I'm going to talk about two very important resources for plant production, which is light and CO2. I'm going to talk about on a different angle by optimizing both components to improve the propagation of young plants in vertical farm environments. I'm going to give you a couple of examples of tomato and cannabis. Before we go into much detail, I want to share with you why I think propagation in vertical farms is a very suitable system. I call this the precision in the propagation, which is precisely controlling the environment in order to improve plant growth in development in a fully enclosed environment. So why is precision in their propagation or PIP a suitable system? Number one is profitable. The product can be grow a large density, it has relatively shorter growing cycles for young plants, and also these young plants are considered high value. Also, it has a large market share. There is a large number of annual edible and ornamental hydrochloral plants that are already produced from young plants, and that number will continue to increase. To give you an example, this is a list of the top 20 vegetables grown in the field in the United States. Out of those, 12% are already produced from transplants, and more will continue to increase. In addition, out of the top 12 fruiting vegetables, annual fruiting vegetables, there is three of them that are already produced from transplants or young plants at a very high number, on different control environment systems. This is not even including all the ornamental plants that are already produced from transplants, so the point is there is a large market size. Also, producing the plants in a completely imprecise indoor environment keeps the plants protected for the uncertainty of weather changes. So with the continued weather uncertainty, the growing cycles are going to change, and they're going to become shorter. So having the ability to grow these plants in the natural control environment to then supply to the final producer will help them reduce the risk by perhaps planting later or harvesting earlier. Also, using this young plant as the main output of an indoor propagation system is as high resource use efficiency. Why? Because the entire plant believes the stem that roots is the final product. So if I go and increase inputs, such as light in CO2, those would directly impact the final product because the entire plant is your product. Also, one that I like a lot is we can create a plant that have a value added. We can cost too much the environmental recipes to increase the raw rate to change the plant architecture or morphology or have different phyrochemicals in the plants. So to give you an example, you can shape plants in a way that may be suitable for aromatic transplant. You have the power of the environment to change the architecture development and growth of these plants. Now, there is a lot of inputs and a lot of variables that you can control in a PIP environment. Such as relative humidity, temperature, light intensity, photo-period, the colors of light or spectrum, CO2 concentration, the air movement, nutrients, oxygen in the roots and irrigation. But today, we're going to focus on two very important factors. This is an example of a greenhouse. And one of the factors that we're going to focus on is light intensity and how you optimize light intensity. But another factor that we typically verse are known as aware of it is CO2 concentration. What is the impact of that CO2 concentration in the air as ongoing plants? So by now you know that light is very important to produce plants. How important was linearly correlated? So an increase in light will linearly increase the plant growth. And the rate of increase depends on the type of plant, but typically more light, more growth to a point. Now let me talk about CO2 a little bit more. Here this is my artistic impression of a leaf with a stomata opening and a stomata cavity. And you know, at the chloroplasts which is the main organelle that produces photosynthesis. We have scientists actually one of the way we measure photosynthetic rate or we estimate photosynthetic rate is by the rate of movement between CO2 in the outside environment in the air into the stomata cavity then to the chloroplasts. So this movement, the rate of the movement of CO2 from us into the stomata cavity is a very good estimator of photosynthesis. But this is mainly, this is mainly driven by diffusion, the delta or the difference between the concentration in the air CO2 enrichment and the concentration in the cavity, you know, the low ambient. That rate of diffusion is greater when the delta is greater, the greater the differences between outside and inside the higher the rate and consequently the higher the photosynthesis, of course, with a lot of resistances the way. So in general, scientists have found that increasing the CO2 concentration form and being 400 micromotor per mole or PPM to elevated to around 700 micromotor per mole or PPM increases yield, through the yield of plants around 20 to 30%. They also see a impact and increase on photosynthesis. So what is the physiological and economical impact of elevated CO2 in vertical farm propagation and the co-optimization with light? I'm going to talk about two examples that we work in my lab, one on tomato and one on cannabis. I'm going to start with tomato and first I want to give all the credit to my now graduated PhD, Dr. Brando Uber, who carry out all the experimentation for the tomato production in indoor environments. The plan material, you know, we use four different tomato cultivars and also we use other props such as watermelon squash, you stock, and cucumber and the resource where more or less the same. So the three CO2 levels that we decided to use was ambient has a control for 100 micromotor per mole elevated to 1000 and we decided to push the envelope in go in go four times higher than ambient to 1000, 600 micromotor per mole. The light levels then we use a low light level, which is a hundred micromotor on a 18 hour photo period 6.5 miles of life average per day. And then we have one is slightly higher and then we have the 200. So this light level of 200 micromotor for meter square per second for 18 hours gives you 13 miles per meter square per day of light is the adequate. The amount of light that I like are ambient CO2 to produce a good quality tomato ceiling in an indoor environment. And because that's the minimum amount of light that I think is good for this plant at our specific density, that will call that my baseline that's my control. Here you have a video of the plants, these are exactly cucumber actually growing in this indoor environment for a short period of time and a different treatments. High density high value precision production. So in this graph. On the bottom here I have the daily integral so just increasing light. And here we have shoot dry mass, which is actually the most tangible characterization of plant growth more dry mass more growth. So this first line is telling me that at this light level we have this growth. And at this light level we have this growth. So the increasing amount of light increase the growth of the tomato plant. And right here this plan is my minimum viable quality plan for indoor system at this light level and under ambient CO2. And when you do the same three different light levels, but now you have different elevated CO2 conditions. So the growth not only increase with the increase of light. By 53% in general, you also increase by the increase of CO2 by 33%. And if you really want to compare the lowest light level in your ambience you to which is a not poor quality plan to a adequate light level and elevators you to there was increasing growth and 95 94%. But now let's look at this differently. Let's say this plan right here at this growth rate or biomass is the minimum quality good quality plan that I meet. Well, if I elevate the CO2, I can get that same dry mass. We match lower light around 28 to 35% lower light. So if the goal is to save energy, you can reduce your light and increase your CO2. But if you want the best of both roles, then this plan here becomes the best plan with adequate levels of light and high levels of CO2. This is how the plan look at reference CO2 and light levels and these will yellow light represents your control. You can notice the morphology. Now let me jump into cannabis. So all the credit for the next slice are from my cream PhDs to Echristian Cajado who executed all of the research. Now cannabis is cannabis young plants that are likely different than the tomatoes. The tomato is a seed that you plant in the soil. You get a seedling ready to go. They can optimize the environment. For young cannabis plants, the ones that we study are the one coming from clones. So you get a little cutting from a mother plant with no roots, a little shoot and you stick it into substrate and put it in a intensive care environment to promote root development. So doing these root development, we wanted to study the impact of both CO2 and light. Here you have a video. Of the system where we go in a different light levels all the way from 50 micromose to 400 micromose, 18 hours for the period. And you can see how you have very tight control of the humidity and change of light intensity. So what happened again here you have in the bottom your increase in light intensity and your root dry mass. I was quite surprised by this result because when the plant has no root having very high light intensity, no props typically leads to a wilting or stress on the plant. Now for this specific cannabis cultivar, the increasing light intensity has long has been managed and environment increased the root dry mass even to high light levels. But what happened when we even increase the CO2, when we increase the CO2 and this is specific cultivar, that root dry mass increase even further. So similar even in a plant that is still developing roots has cannabis, we have a similar impact on the CO2 and light called the message. Now let me go back to the example of tomato, just to calculate some numbers. So what is the cost of increasing light in CO2? We can estimate this by modeling a commercial propagation facility and known exactly how much light you need for that commercial facility. And based on that, we can calculate the electricity usage to see how much electricity we use and therefore how much cost is going to be at a specific electricity rate. We can also calculate how much CO2 is using the commercial chamber by knowing the amount of plants we have in that chamber by knowing the photosynthetic rate. So how much CO2 has occupied those plants actually measuring and knowing that by understanding what is the concentration I want to have inside this environment, understanding how liquid is my chamber. Now I have much CO2 has been lost, which typically is very small in the environment and my outside concentration and based on all of those numbers in addition to the amount of time the plants are active, I can calculate the daily amount of CO2 supply. I need to put in this environment to make sure the plants are enriched with CO2. This is what I get. This is just an example using 9 cents per kilo hour, $19 per kilo hour of electricity. And this is the example what I get on cost. Let's walk you through this tape. So this first row is your control. Add a coin amount of light, 13 daylight in the row and I'm being CO2 concentration and 17 days to graph. So here you can see my light cost is $2.26. CO2 costs is $1.1 per meter square and my total cost per meter square is $2.57 per meter square. And that will give me the good viable plan with a grow rate with dry mass of 45 million hours dry mass. So what happens when I reduce the light increases CO2 to have comparable dry mass? Well then I can produce this plan in the same amount of time and it's going to cost me cheaper to produce per meter square because I reduce the light and have the same product at the end. It's slightly different more for you by saying broadly. So I want the best of both roles we have in adequate light in elevators you to where I can reduce the production time reduce the CO2 level to 15 days. The light cost is going to be lower. Why? Because we come in the light zone for less amount of time. The CO2 cost is going to be much higher by comparable to light cost to give me even a cheaper production cost when I elevate the CO2 than when I don't because I'm reducing the production time. And at the end, I'm going to have bigger plan 33% more biomass. So to summarize, we can by called to my scene light and CO2 we can increase grow rate and time quality reduce production time and reduce the production cost. Thank you very much to my team. And thank you very much for listening.
